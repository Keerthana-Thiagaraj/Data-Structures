**Binary Search Tree Implementation using Java-8**

A Binary Search Tree is a Node based data structure in which each node has utmost two subtrees termed as left child and right child. Left sub-tree contains values lesser than the node's key and right sub-tree contains values greater than the node's key.
Duplicacy check must be carried out while inserting each value to the node as it is not allowed in a Binary Search Tree.

Generally traversal of the tree takes place in 3 ways:

  - Inorder(Left, Root, Right)
  - Preorder(Root, Left, Right)
  - Postorder(Left, Right, Root)
 
In this example, I have explained about the inorder traversal.
  
Please follow the below steps for the implementation.

1. Clone the project to your workspace as follows:

git clone https://github.com/Keerthana-Thiagaraj/Data-Structures.git

2. Run the application based on the IDE choice
